where *.txt files are single column lists of uniprot IDs for proteins in sets of interest. nsg_human.txt contains the human SGome at time of submission. Other lists are control groups and can be altered as desired.  human_pme.data is a metafile to contain the protein features used. It is a tab separated file with columns for:

uniprot_ID
percent disorder (DISOPRED3)
protein abundance (paxdb)
protein solubility (Camsol)
binary interactions (PCA+Y2H+APMS)
sequence length
Largest IDR (>=30AA)
Number annotated Phosphoylation Sites
Pi-Pi interaction score (Pscore)
RNA binding
Number of Morfs
Number of LCR (fLPS)
Catgranule Score
